Start
    Initialize GUI window (frm) with title "Coyote Inn - Nightly Charges" and size 400x200
    
    Create labels, entry fields, and buttons in the GUI window:
        - Label(lblMonth) for month input
        - Entry field(txtMonth) for month input
        - Label(lblNights) for number of nights input
        - Entry field(txtNights) for number of nights input
        - Label(lblTextTotal) to display "Total Charges:"
        - Label(lblTotal) to display the calculated total charges
        - Button(btnCalc) with text "Calculate" linked to calc_charges function
        - Button(btnExit) with text "Exit" linked to exit_program function

    Define function calc_charges:
        - Get month from txtMonth
        - Get number of nights from txtNights
        
        - Determine nightly rate based on the month:
            - If month is between 1 and 3, nightly_rate is 80
            - If month is between 4 and 6, nightly_rate is 90
            - If month is between 7 and 9, nightly_rate is 120
            - If month is between 10 and 12, nightly_rate is 100
            - If month is invalid, set nightly_rate to 0 and show an error message
        
        - Calculate total charges using the formula: total_charges = nights * nightly_rate
        - Update str_total_charges with the formatted total charges

    Define function exit_program:
        - Destroy the GUI window (frm) to exit the program

    Start the GUI main loop (frm.mainloop())

End
