1. Prompt the user to input a list of numbers separated by spaces
   Input: numInput
   
2. Split the input string into a list of strings
   numListString = split numInput by spaces

3. Convert the list of strings to a list of integers
   numList = convert each element in numListString to an integer

4. Call the sort_integers function to sort the list of integers in descending order
   sort_integers(numList)

5. Convert the sorted list of integers to an array
   sortedArray = create an array using the 'i' type code with elements from numList

6. Convert the elements of the array to strings and join them with spaces
   resultString = join the elements of sortedArray with spaces after converting each to a string

7. Display the sorted numbers in a single line
   print resultString

Procedure sort_integers(numList):
    Input: numList (a list of integers)

    1. Get the size of the input list
       size = length of numList

    2. Iterate over the elements of the list using an outer loop (i)
       for i in range from 0 to size - 2:
       
        3. Iterate over the elements of the list using an inner loop (j)
           for j in range from 0 to size - i - 2:

            4. Compare adjacent elements (numList[j] and numList[j+1])
               if numList[j] < numList[j+1]:

                5. Swap the values if they are in the wrong order
                   Swap numList[j] and numList[j+1]

    Output: numList (the input list is modified in place, sorted in descending order)
